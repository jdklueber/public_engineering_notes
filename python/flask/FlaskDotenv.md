# Flask and dotenv

`.flaskenv`

```bash
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

If you install the `python-dotenv` package, you can create a `.flaskenv` file like the one above to make the `flask run` command work the way you want it to without having to mess around with the actual system environment file.
