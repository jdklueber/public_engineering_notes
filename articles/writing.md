# Better Writing For Programmers

* Writing for humans is different from writing for computers
* It is a process that can be learned

## Getting Started

* Why are you writing this?
  * Interrogate the situation to figure out what your goals are
  * Inform?  Persuade?  Entertain?  Instruct?
* Know your audience
  * Sometimes there is more than one audience
  * Be clear on who your audience is
    * This informs your word choices, your structure, your argument, your delivery method...
    * Multiple audiences may need multiple documents or modalities
    * Bear in mind the following:
      * Education
      * Perspective
      * Goals
      * Time constraints
* Good writing begins with a clear thesis
  * If you can't sum up your thesis in a single sentence, you're not ready to start writing
* Organize your thoughts into a coherent narrative structure
  * People remember stories not facts
  * What is the story you are trying to tell?
* Make an outline
  * Do not start writing anything until you've got the outline down
  * Highlight key points first
  * Determine what additional points are needed to connect the dots
  * Make sure that all points support your thesis and the narrative structure you've chosen
  * This is the best time to make structural changes to your work- it's cheaper here than it is after you've spent time writing and polishing

## The rules of the first draft

* The first draft is about getting all the important ideas down with grammatically correct sentences and a structure that works
  * Forget the introduction
  * Forget the conclusion
* Flesh out the outline into complete sentences
  * Outlines are often very terse.  Start by fleshing out the outline into full topic sentences.
* Flesh out those sentences into paragraphs
* Don't worry about spelling or grammar
* Word selection
* Cite your sources

## Rules for the second draft

* The second draft is for fixing grammar, spelling, and word selection problems
* Common grammatical problems
  * Spelling counts
  * Sentence fragments
  * Commas
  * Apostrophes
* Verify that any jargon being used is necessary
  * Provide definitions if the audience isn't expected to know a necessary term

## The third draft and beyond

* The goals of the third draft:
  * Cut anything that doesn't support the thesis
  * Find and patch any holes in the argument
  * Connect all the dots
* Write an introduction that grabs the reader and encapsulates the entire document
  * It's important to do this AFTER you've finished your first draft.  Prematurely written introductions usually have to be discarded.
* Offer an ending that will persuade and inspire
  * Closing argument- sums everything up
  * Call to action if appropriate

* Use the active voice
  * "I want a soda" not "a soda is wanted by me."
* Use organizational techniques such as subheadings, numbering, and bullet points, to lead your reader through the text
* Avoid useless words and phrases
  * Adverbs are common culprits
  * "He was a really good pianist" can be shortened to "He was a good pianist" without losing any meaning or punch
  * Shorter sentences are more punchy
* Every argument should be supported by evidence or analysis; the more specific, the better
* Use appendices for supporting material that is relevant but might interrupt the flow of your document
* Acknowledge the costs or limitations of what you are proposing
  * Failing to do so can look dishonest
  * Answer the questions and objections so your readers don't have to
* Show, don't tell
  * Again: people remember stories, not facts

## Final polish

* The goal of polish is to identify the key points of the document and drive them home
* This is for the final draft - all the structural changes should already be finalized
* Insert graphics and photos that support your analysis
  * Pick your battles- let your pictures and graphics hit the major points hard, don't dilute their impact.
* Interject the voices and emotions of the people you are writing about
  * Especially when writing about situations and events outside of your personal experience
  * Especially when writing about marginalized people or subcultures
* Use stories to reinforce your key points
  * As always:  people remember stories not facts
* Make strategic use of titles and subject lines
  * Make sure that you're catching attention accurately up front
  * Avoid clickbait
* Have someone unconnected to the project read your draft
  * Expert blindness is a thing- getting someone to read your work will help you find holes you left via unquestioned assumptions
* Kill your darlings
  * It doesn't matter if it's well written.  If it doesn't support your argument, scrap it.

## Final thoughts

* Begin with the end in mind
* Know your audience
* If it's worth writing, it's worth editing
